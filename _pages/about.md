I am a PhD candidate in computer science at UMass Amherst working in the [Statistical Social Language Analysis Lab](http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/), advised by [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com/). I am interested in developing fair, robust statistical text analysis tools to answer social science, particularly sociolinguistic, questions. Currently, I am working on developing models to identify dialectal variation on social media.

I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I received my B.A. in mathematics from Wellesley College.
